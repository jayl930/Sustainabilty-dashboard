      "        \"abstract\": \"<p>This article outlines a learning intervention which the authors call Learning by Design. The goal of this intervention is classroom and curriculum transformation, and the professional learning of teachers. The experiment involves the practical application of the learning theory to everyday classroom practice. Its ideas are grounded in pedagogical principles originally articulated in the Multiliteracies project, an approach to teaching and learning that addresses literacy and learning in the context of new media and the globalizing knowledge economy. The need for a new approach to learning arises from a complex range of factors - among them, changes in society and the economy; the potential for new forms of communication made possible by emerging technologies; and rising expectations amongst learners that education will maximize their potential for personal fulfillment, civic participation and access to work. The authors first brought together the Learning by Design team of researchers and teachers in 2003 in order to reflect upon and create new and dynamic learning environments. A series of research and development activities were embarked upon in Australia and, more recently, in the United States, exploring the potentials of new pedagogical approaches, assisted by digital technologies, to transform today's learning environments and create learning for the future - learning environments which could be more relevant to a changing world, more effective in meeting community expectations and which manage educational resources more efficiently. One of the key challenges was to create learning environments which engaged the sensibilities of learners who are increasingly immersed in digital and global lifestyles - from the entertainment sources they choose to the way they work and learn. It was also about enabling teachers to explicitly track and be aware of the relationship between their pedagogical choices and their students' learning outcomes.</p>\"\n",

The manifestation of this single-chain structure (commonly measured by scattering experiments) is the correlation function \\u03c9(r), which is the probability that two sites on the same chain are separated by a distance r. The evaluation of \\u03c9(r) from the RIS model requires laborious statistical averages, and, as a consequence, various approximations of \\u03c9(r) are of importance. Previous approximation schemes have focused on the long-wavelength regime. However, many physical phenomena and properties are very sensitive to local correlations and understanding such behavior requires an approximate \\u03c9(r) which is accurate on all length scales.

Comparison with exact valence bond calculations for short polyene chains and the infinite chain limit reveals that the method is quantitatively accurate for the polarizability and qualitatively reliable for other properties and degrees of bond alternation.

The specific case when the rotational defects severely localize the \\u03c0 electrons (strong disorder) is treated in detail. The disordered polymer configurations are classified by the defect density or mean conjugation length as the primary order parameter. The effects of conjugation length fluctuations and both long and short range defect interactions on the optical properties are determined.

We studied different flyer designs launched by laser pulses of different energies, pulse durations and beam diameters, that produced km s<sup>-1</sup> impacts with transparent target materials. Laser-launching Al flyers 25-100 \\u03bcm thick cemented to glass substrates is usually thought to involve laser vaporization of a portion of the flyer, which creates many difficulties associated with loss of integrity and heating of the flyer material. However, in the system used here, the launch mechanism was surprising and unexpected: it involved optical damage at the glass/cement/flyer interface, with very little laser light reaching the flyer itself. In fact the flyers launched in this manner behaved almost identically to multilayer flyers that were optically shielded from the laser pulses and insulated from heat generated by the pulses. Launching flyers with nanosecond laser pulses creates undesirable reverberating shocks in the flyer. In some cases, with 10 ns launch pulses, the thickest flyers were observed to lose integrity. But with stretched 20 ns pulses, we showed that the reverberations damped out prior to impact with targets, and that the flyers maintained their integrity during flight. Flyer impacts with salt, glass, fused silica, and acrylic polymer were studied by PDV, and the durations of fully supported shocks in those media were determined, and could be varied from 5 to 23 ns.</p>\"\n",

In Experiment 2, subjects were given Concept Scenarios (i.e., a description of the principles and concepts that apply to a problem and the order in which they apply) and asked to generate problems that matched the scenarios. Interviews conducted immediately following the experiment asked subjects to explain how the problems posed matched either the specified concepts, or the Concept Scenarios. Findings indicate that, when followed by an interview, problem posing is a powerful assessment tool for probing students' understanding of physics concepts, as well as their ability to transfer their knowledge to novel contexts. In many instances, students posed appropriate, solvable problems, yet displayed major flaws in conceptual understanding. This suggests that even good novices are lacking in the way their conceptual knowledge is organized in memory and linked to problem contexts and procedures.

It is interesting to ask what influences the success of analogies when students believe they understand the target situation. If this understanding is not normative, instruction must aim at conceptual change rather than simply conceptual growth. Through the analysis of four case studies of tutoring interviews (two of which achieved some noticeable conceptual change and two of which did not) we propose a preliminary list of factors important for success in overcoming misconceptions via analogical reasoning. First, there must be a usable anchoring conception. Second, the analogical connection between an anchoring example and the target situation may need to be developed explicitly through processes such as the use of intermediate, \\\"bridging\\\" analogies. Third, it may be necessary to engage the student in a process of analogical reasoning in an interactive teaching environment, rather than simply presenting the analogy in tetext or lecture. Finally, the result of this process may need to be more than analogical transfer of abstract relational structure. The analogies may need to be used to enrich the target situation, leading to the student's construction of a new explanatory model.</p>\"\n",

Appropriate changes to the pH and temperature can increase the drug release from the particles. Because of the released drug, the particles were found to be cytotoxic to human breast cancer cells in vitro. Such magnetic nanoparticles, with the potential to retain drug under physiological conditions and release the drug in conditions where the pH is lower or temperature is higher, may be useful in magnetic drug targeting by reducing the side effects of the drug caused to healthy tissues.

      "        \"abstract\": \"<p>Detecting small molecular targets such as metal ions is just as important as detecting large molecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins, but the field of metal ion sensors has not yet been well developed. A good example of a metal ion target is mercury, which is highly toxic, widely distributed in the environment and affects human health. To develop a diagnostic platform for metal ions, we demonstrate that functional DNA-linked gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can quickly and simply detect and quantify Hg<sup>2+</sup> ions in aqueous solution, with high sensitivity and selectivity over competing metal ions. A linker DNA molecule containing thymine residues and sequences complementary to the DNA on the AuNPs was designed to aggregate DNA-functionalized AuNPs. When Hg <sup>2+</sup> ions were introduced into this system, they induced the linker DNA to fold by forming thymine-Hg<sup>2+</sup>-thymine bonds. The linker DNA's folding caused the AuNPs to rapidly disassemble, which caused a discernable color change in the solution from purple to red. The limit of detection for Hg<sup>2+</sup> in the present method is 5.4 nM, which is below the 10 nM maximum contaminant level defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for drinking water. Our results show that this Hg<sup>2+</sup> detection method has excellent selectivity over other divalent metal ions (e.g. Pb <sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Zn <sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and Ba <sup>2+</sup>). This system has been converted into a dipstick test using lateral-flow devices, making it even more practical for point-of-care diagnostics.</p>\"\n",

      "        \"abstract\": \"<p>The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of intracellular adaptors and sensors plays a critical role in the assembly of signaling complexes involved in innate host defense against pathogens and in the regulation of inflammatory responses. The cytosolic receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) recognizes viral RNA in a 5\\u2032-triphosphate-dependent manner and initiates an antiviral signaling cascade. Upon viral infection, the N-terminal CARDs of RIG-I undergo the K<sub>63</sub>-linked ubiquitination induced by tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), critical for the interaction of RIG-I with its downstream signaling partner MAVS/VISA/IPS-1/Cardif. Here, we demonstrate the distinct roles of RIG-I first and second CARD in TRIM25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination: TRIM25 binds the RIG-I first CARD and subsequently ubiquitinates its second CARD. The T55I mutation in RIG-I first CARD abolishes TRIM25 interaction, whereas the K172R mutation in the second CARD eliminates polyubiquitin attachment. The necessity of the intact tandem CARD for RIG-I function is further evidenced by a RIG-I splice variant (SV) whose expression is robustly up-regulated upon viral infection. The RIG-I SV carries a short deletion (amino acids 36-80) within the first CARD and thereby loses TRIM25 binding, CARD ubiquitination, and downstream signaling ability. Furthermore, because of its robust inhibition of virus-induced RIG-I multimerization and RIG-I-MAVS signaling complex formation, this SV effectively suppresses the RIG-I-mediated IFN-\\u03b2 production. This study not only elucidates the vital role of the intact tandem CARD for TRIM25-mediated RIG-I activation but also identifies the RIG-I SV as an off-switch regulator of its own signaling pathway.</p>\"\n",

With Conus striatus and Conus victoriae venom as models, bromination, carboxylation and glycosylation modifications are identified through characteristics such as isotopic distribution and labile losses observed during mass spectrometric analysis. This modification screening approach enables the identification of a C. victoriae bromo-carboxy-conotoxin, designated vc5c, as a candidate for detailed mass spectrometric analysis. Using a cDNA sequence coupled with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and nanoelectrospray ionization-ion trap-mass spectrometry, the sequence of vc5c is determined to be ICCYPNXWCCD, where W is 6-bromotryptophan, X is \\u03b3-carboxy glutamate and C is disulfide-linked cysteine.
